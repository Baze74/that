Restraint","description":"When a young data scientist unexpectedly steals the heart of a highly sought after executive, the passion between them could lead her into a whole new world of sexual expression.\n\nStandalone in the Professional Restraint series\n\n***\n\nAfter a string of one-sided relationships left her feeling unfulfilled and unsatisfied, Ella put her love life on the back burner to focus on her career. But when she is called in last minute to give a huge presentation for her business partner, she not only lands the sought after account, but catches the eye of the handsome COO, Liam. Most attention from men just sets the shy Ella on edge, but somehow Liam is the exception-the magnetic pull between them not only enlivens Ella, but he makes her feel safe.\n\nLiam is focused, driven, and extremely controlled in his professional and personal lives. Both his perfectionism and his particular tastes demand it. An experienced Dominant, Liam has rarely considered or found fulfillment in relationships with women outside of the lifestyle, but innocent, guileless Ella sets a passionate fire like nothing else raging within him. Not only is she brilliant and gorgeous, but, in her, he can sense a natural submissive despite her lack of experience.\n\nAs Ella struggles with having been burned so many times before, Liam wonders if he'd ever be able to reveal the truth and be accepted. Will she be able to trust him, and even if she does, will all of him be too much to handle?\n\n***\n\nWeekly updates on Tuesdays.

She has school, homework, her job at the Coffee shop where she drinks way too much caffeine to be healthy, and the rest of the time she is watching her little sister while her mother is at work. She thinks that everything will remain the same as she starts her college classes, but that all changes when a new friend of hers introduces her to an attractive guy that she can't seem to get out of her head.\n\nGrayson Dark, a 22-year-old Alpha of his pack, has been searching for his mate since he turned 16. All hope is lost until one of his pack mates strolls into his home with the most magnificent scent- his mate's scent. After only slightly maiming his pack mate, it is revealed that his mate is close by- and human. \n\nWithout understanding the supernatural world existing around her, Thea will have to learn to look past Grayson's faults- mainly his possessiveness and anger issues- while staying out of danger from unknown threats and learning her place at Grayson's side. \n\nOh... and keeping her grades up.

She aborted the child she had with her husband just so she could return to her first boyfriend, Fu Xing. Yet, Fu Xing had no intention of reconciling with her, and even ridiculed her for flattering herself. \n\nWith that, Si Mi felt that she had been abandoned by the world. She wandered the streets dejectedly and was killed by a car that malfunctioned. As her soul floated in midair, she saw her stepsister secretly meeting up with the driver who killed her to give him a large sum of hush money. \n\nShe even saw her stepmother, who had always doted on her, say, \"That girl finally died. At least my efforts weren't wasted in spoiling her to the point of being brainless and arrogant! My dear daughter, you can finally relax and be with Fu Xing now.\"\n\nFinally, Si Mi saw her ex-husband attending her funeral, and then took revenge for her death. Her supposedly disfigured husband even removed his mask for the first time before her portrait. The man's flawless appearance seemed to be a gift from the gods. Every inch of him was meticulously perfect, and he wasn't as hideous as the rumors painted him to be.\n\nThen, Si Mi lost all senses. When she opened her eyes, she found herself lying on a bed naked while a man rammed into her from above. It was her husband, Fu Zhen! \n\nShe had just attended her own funeral moments ago as a wandering soul, so why was she in Fu Zhen's bed now and making love to him? It seems that Si Mi was reborn back to the time when she had just married her husband. \n\nDuring this time, she had yet to abort Fu Zhen's child, and hadn't yet fallen into her stepmother and stepsister's scheme!\n\nWhat perplexed Si Mi even more was that she now possessed the power of telekinesis after being reborn. Splendid! \n\nShe swore not to be toyed with anymore in this life.\nShe would also take revenge! \n\nMore importantly... she had to compensate Fu Zhen for what she owed him.\n\nShe would give her best to this man who once loved her deeply.","cover":"https://img.wattpad.com/cover/324035300-256-k191947.jpg","cover_requires_opt_in":false,"tags":["sweet","backintime","husbandchasing","romance","chinesenovel","faceslapping","doting","revenge","drama","rebirth","webnovel"],"isPaid":false,"paidModel":"","isPromoted":false,"completed":true,"mature":true,"numParts":200,"firstPartId":1276538085},{"id":166210511,"sources":["tagPreferredOnboarding"],"title":"A Groom for Christmas","description":"Charlotte \"Charlie\" Duncan has to prepare for the Christmas season and her best friend's wedding, while contending with a reality TV executive that's more interested in drama than happily ever afters.
